# Iteration3

Media-center for an autistic adult with problematic behaviour in need for non-intrusive technology. Less stimulus, and basic functionalities facilitated for his competance, ability to act independently in interaction with the prototype. 

The processing code and Arduino code make it possible to read RFID-tags, which triggers specific Movies or Albums the user likes. Three buttons which allows for pausing/continuing, fasting-forward and rewinding media file. 

In this iteration the code is adjustet to work on less processing capacity, lower memory. In other words, adjusted to fit raspberry pi 3 running raspbian jessi, wired to arduino Uno. Larger albums wont work, due to this lack of capacity.
